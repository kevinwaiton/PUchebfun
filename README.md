# PUchebfun

PUchebfun provides a way to represent multivariate functions (up to 3D) with a partition of unity approximation and Chebyshev tensor product polynomials. These approximations are infinitely smooth, highly accurate and memory efficient. The overlapping domains are formed through recursive bisection, and are organized into a binary tree.
